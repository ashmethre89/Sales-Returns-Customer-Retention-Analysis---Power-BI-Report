🧩 Data Modeling Approach

1. Star Schema Design : Implemented a star schema for performance and clarity
2. Fact table at order-item grain; Separate dimension tables for Date, Product, Customer, and Geography

3. Product Dimension Handling
Created a deduplicated Product dimension in Power Query
Ensured one-to-many relationship between Product and Orders

4. Returns Modeling Decision
For this portfolio:
Returns were merged into Orders to create a Returned Flag

Rationale:
Given the small dataset and limited return attributes, merging simplified the model, improved performance, and maintained a clean star schema.
In a production-scale model, Returns would be handled as a separate fact table with DAX-based net calculations.

5. Filtering Strategy: Used single-direction filtering from dimensions → fact
Followed Power BI best practices for performance and time intelligence
