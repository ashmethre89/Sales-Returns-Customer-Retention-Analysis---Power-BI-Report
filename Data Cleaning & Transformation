Used Excel and Power Query for Data Cleaning & Transformation
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Handled Missing Categories
Derived missing Category values using Product ID naming conventions
Example:
FUR-BO-10002202 → Category = Furniture

2. Handled Missing Sub-Categories
Identified sub-categories using Product ID patterns
Example:
%-BO-% → Sub-Category = Bookcases

3. Duplicate Handling
Duplicate Product Names were retained (descriptive attribute)
Duplicate Product IDs were removed to enforce a valid business key

4. Returns Integration
Returns table contained only Order IDs with no additional attributes
Merged with Orders using a Left Join to create a Returned Flag
Simplified downstream calculations and model complexity

5. Date Table Creation
Created a custom Date table using DAX
Enabled time intelligence (YoY, MoM, Rolling 12 Months)
Assumed Fiscal Year End = December

6. Standardization
Standardized column names, data types, formats, and summarization
Set appropriate data categories (Date, Geography, Numeric measures)
